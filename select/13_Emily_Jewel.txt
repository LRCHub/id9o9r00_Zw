Woke up to find
I lost my mind
Lost heart, lost nerve
I lost my favorite word
Emily

I take my cigarettes
I give 'em a smoke
Oh god, my heart feels froze
I've lost something it seems
I've misplaced my favorite thing
Emily

Where does love go if it can't find a home
One moment here then gone
With no forwarding address
Love no longer has a house or residence in flesh

I take the keys, I get in the car
To outrun this, man, I'd have to go real far
Where mercy wears lace, and bottles are thieves
Which of these took you from me?
Emily

I face myself, but there's this draft inside
Parts of me drowned, in perpetual tide
I wanna call names, I wanna throw things around
But no bar can buy forgiveness
Another round for
Emily

Where does love go if it can't find a home
One moment here then gone
With no forwarding address
Love no longer has a house or residence in flesh

I go in the bedroon, turn on the light
It's like an empty altar
No angel in sight
Religion with no temple
No place to take my worship to
No god for my eyes to see
No fruit to lay at the feet
Of Emily

Gone
