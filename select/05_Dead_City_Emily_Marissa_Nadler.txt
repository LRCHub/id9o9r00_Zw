I was coming apart those days
I don't give a damn about the way
Colors on the trees change from red to green
It's a dead city, Emily
But it was a blaze, still, I had to stay
With that band, Emily
I saw the light today
Opened up the door
And the other man would run, run away
And we're stuck inside the moon
And the other man would run, run away
And we'll need something more
I was coming apart those days
I don't give a damn about the way
Birds fly in the breeze, things you say to me
It's a dead city, Emily
I cannot recall leaving, we said all
It's a dead city in between
I saw the light today
Opened up the door
And the other man would run, run away
And we're stuck inside the wall
Oh, it looked so bright today
Opened up the door
And the other man would run, run away
And leave something more
And the other man would run, run away
From the house and to the shore
Dead city, Emily
Dead city, Emily
Dead city, Emily
Dead city, Emily
