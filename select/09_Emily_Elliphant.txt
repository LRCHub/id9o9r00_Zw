Emily, Emily
I'm on my way, ah
What's up now?
Not again, really?
Calling, calling, calling
What up?
Why you always gotta do this?

Don't dig up dead birds, Emily
Don't hit the dog's claw
Don't muck my damn paws now, Emily
We used to like you before, before
'Cause we could have some fun right, didn't we?
Sharp, lifting our crown
But now you steal my shit all the time
Why do you have to steal my shit all the time?

Emily will, Emily don't
Emily do whatever she wants
Emily will, Emily don't
Emily do whatever she wants

Why are you always on that hammer all the time
Emily? (Yeah?)
That old china got you good now, huh
Emily? (Emily) yeah

She said, "Your daddy knows my daddy
In the local swimming pool"
And yeah, we stole two-hundred dollars
And spent it all on laser doom
She said, "Your daddy knows my daddy
Yes, your daddy knows my dad"
She said, "Your daddy knows my daddy (my daddy knows your dad)
The daddies we never had" (yeah, yeah)

Just stop doing what you're doing Emily
And everything before, yup
Whatever happens, we are still family
Just not kicking it right, nah

Yeah, 'cause Emily will, Emily don't
Emily do whatever she wants
Emily will, Emily don't
Emily do whatever she wants

And she will not repent this (no, no, no, no)
But we still stay connected (connected)
Because your daddy knows my daddy
And my daddy knows your dad
Daddy knows my daddy
Yes, your daddy knows my dad
She said, "Your daddy knows my daddy (my daddy knows your dad)
The daddies we never had" (yeah, right)

I think your daddy actually owe me some money (ah, no)
Or actually my dad, he owes my dad some money
Hey daddy, you got some money for an ice cream?
Which one? Ice cream
'Cause we need ice cream
This Emily, yeah, is my new friend, yeah, your dad
Yeah, yeah, her dad, knows you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly,
He owes you money, yeah, that's, that's right
Can we please go to like a festival or something?
Do something fun?
Uh, you know, I heard
Alright, fuck it
Did you record that?
